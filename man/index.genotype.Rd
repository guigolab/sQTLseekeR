\description{
Index genotype file. The file must be tab-separated and ordered by chr, start, end
position. Moreover, the first four columns must be 'chr', 'start', 'end' and 'snpId'
information. Then each additional column is named using a sample ID and represents
its genotype. The genotype is coded as follow: 0 for ref/ref, 1 for ref/mut, 2 for
mut/mut and -1 for missing values. The input file should be a text file.
